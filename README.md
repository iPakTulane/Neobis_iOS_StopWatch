## Timer
The timer mode also features three buttons, a field for displaying the remaining time, and an input field for setting the desired time. The buttons in timer mode are:

- Start: Commences the countdown based on the time set in the input field.
- Pause: Pauses the timer countdown, allowing users to resume from the paused time by pressing the Start button.
- Stop: Stops the timer countdown and resets it to the originally set time.

## StopWatch
The stopwatch mode includes three primary buttons and a display field for showing the elapsed time. The buttons are as follows:

- Start: Initiates the stopwatch, starting the count and displaying the elapsed time.
- Pause: Pauses the stopwatch, allowing users to continue from the paused time by pressing the Start button.
- Stop: Stops the stopwatch and resets the elapsed time to zero.

## Usage
This application is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Users can switch between the stopwatch and timer modes by toggling between them using a user-friendly interface. The intuitive button layout ensures that users can effortlessly control time tracking as per their requirements.
